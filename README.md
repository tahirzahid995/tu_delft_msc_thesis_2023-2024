01 is the folder containing the script for Gemetry Generation
02 is the folder containing the script for Generator (VAE/CVAE + surrogate model + gradient descent)
DATASETS contains datasets. DATASET 24 is the one used for the report but other datasets can be generated by running the main.py script in Geometry Generation and running the Perfomance Evaluation. 


## Running the code
Two main directories are used for running the code:

## 01
This has the code for Geometry Generation. 
This includes making the dataset for the force densities

#### How to run the code
1. Migrate to the location of the folder '01'
2. Make a virtual environment
3. Install the requirements.txt file
4. Run the main.py file.

## 02
This has the code for the Data Structuring and Generator.

#### How to run the code
1. Migrate to the location of the folder '02'
2. Make a virtual environment
3. Install the requirements.txt file
4. Run the 'cvae_surr_gd_COMBINED.ipynb' file
